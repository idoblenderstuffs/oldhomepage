        This one is kinda obvious to put here. It's what I sink most of my time into, and is really just my main hobby. It's FNaF animations made in Blender.

        Similar situation to my Youtube channel. Here's all of my models in case anybody wants them. Comes with alternative download options and all. These are all for the latest versions of Blender (3.4ish right now), although if SFM ports are made, those will be linked too.

        This was an unblocked games website I made for my school. Someone obviously snitched and ruined the fun (and days of effort) that this site brought. It's now just a subdomain to this site, but it's still blocked if you go to it because my school has rock hard security,

      </h5>
      <p>
        Not really something that I've made myself, but it works on my school ipads and I've worked to make it easily accessable during school. I did make the google drive folder myself, so that people don't have to wait to get home to download roms, since all of those sites are blocked.

      </h5>
      <p>
        These are some programs I made for porting models into the Source engine. I know there are other programs and websites for this, that probably do it better, but I wanted to make my own. I might make a web version some day just for fun. I resent Source porting nowadays, but these tools really helped me make it a lot easier.

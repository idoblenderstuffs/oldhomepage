		Similar situation to my Youtube channel. Here's all of my models 
		in case anybody wants them. Comes with alternative download options 
		and all. These are all for the latest versions of Blender (3.4ish 
		right now), although if SFM ports are made, those will be linked 
		too.<br><br>

		This was an unblocked games website I made for my school. Someone 
		obviously snitched and ruined the fun (and days of effort) that 
		this site brought. It's now just a subdomain to this site, but it's 
		still blocked if you go to it because my school has rock hard 
		security. The only benefit was being unblocked but it isn't anymore. 
		Just keeping it because it means a lot to me. It's my first ACTUAL 
		web project.<br><br>

		Not really something that I've made myself, but it works on my school
		ipads and I've worked to make it easily accessable during school. I

		to wait to get home to download roms, since all of those sites are 
		blocked.<br><br>

		These are some programs I made for porting models into the Source 
		engine. I know there are other programs and websites for this, that 
		probably do it better, but I wanted to make my own. I might make a 
		web version some day just for fun. I resent Source porting nowadays, 
		but these tools really helped me make it a lot easier. Includes a 
		QC maker and VMT maker.<br><br>
